# Tiktok+

Tiktok+ is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your Tiktok journey by resolving common navigation issues and improving overall usability. Seamlessly integrated with Tiktok's platform, this extension focuses on delivering a smoother and more enjoyable user experience without altering the core essence of the Tiktok app.

## Current Features

- **Enhanced History Navigation**: Say goodbye to the instant back to home, even though you just wanted to go back to the last video you watched. Tiktok+ will now remember your last position in the feed and take you back to that exact position when you press the back button.

## Installation

Tiktok+ is unfortunately not available on the Chrome Web Store. However, you can still install it manually by following these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://www.github.com/lukasolsen/tiktokplus/releases) page.
2. Enable Chrome Developer Mode by navigating to `chrome://extensions` and toggling the switch in the top right corner.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner and select the folder containing the extension files.
4. You should now see the Tiktok+ extension in your list of installed extensions. If you don't, try refreshing the page.
